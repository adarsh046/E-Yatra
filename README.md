# E-Yatra
This project was developed using Netbeans IDE and MySQL.

It is to fetch, book train tickets on the client side and admins can add trains available and their timmings etc.

Project files are not available but the code and UI designs are provided within the report. So you can have some idea (how to do it by yourself?) and support while making your own project.

Note: - You need to make your own database in MySQL and all the designs in NetBeans and connect each other using JDBC or any other which is compatible.
